# COVID19 Global project 

Made by Rahul Sharma & Anmol Deep Gupta 

What are the goals of your assignment?
We analysed the COVID-19 cases worldwide from Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.
- We calculated total global cases, death rates, and deaths per day and did the same for US.
- Plotted interactive graphs and spatial bubble charts.


## Few cool feaures: 
- Automatically gets the latest dataset on the day you run the notebook


## To run:
Our notebook uses numpy, pandas and plotly.

To install plotly for this project. Which helps plot interactive graphs. Use 

pip install plotly==4.7.1 

or 

conda install -c plotly plotly=4.7.1
